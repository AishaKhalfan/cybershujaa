> Wireshark is a useful tool for anyone working with networks and can be

**Part 1: Capture and Analyze Local ICMP Data in Wireshark**

In Part 1 of this lab, you will ping another PC on the LAN and capture
ICMP requests and replies in Wireshark. You will also look inside the
frames captured for specific information. This analysis should help to
clarify how packet headers are used to transport data to their
destination.

**Step 1: Retrieve your PC interface addresses.**

For this lab, you will need to retrieve your PC IP address and its
network interface card (NIC) physical address, also called the MAC
address.

> a.In a command prompt window, enter ipconfig /all, to the IP address
> of your PC interface, its description, and its MAC (physical) address.

>
> b.Ask a team member or team members for their PC IP address and
> provide your PC IP address to them. Do not provide them with your MAC
> address at this time

**Step 2: Start Wireshark and begin capturing data.**

> a.Navigate to Wireshark. Double-click the desired interface to start
> the packet capture. Make sure the desired interface has traffic.

> b.Information will start scrolling down the top section in Wireshark.
> The data lines will appear in different colors based on protocol
>
> This information can scroll by very quickly depending on what
> communication is taking place between your PC and the LAN. We can
> apply a filter to make it easier to view and work with the data that
> is being captured by Wireshark.
>
> For this lab, we are only interested in displaying **ICMP (ping)

> **Step 3: Examine the captured data.**
>
> Examine the data that was generated by the ping requests of your team
> member PC. Wireshark data is displayed in three sections: 1) The top
> section displays the list of PDU frames captured with a summary of the
> IP packet information listed; 2) the middle section lists PDU
> information for the frame selected in the top part of the screen and
> separates a captured PDU frame by its protocol layers; and 3) the
> bottom section displays the raw data of each layer. The raw data is
> displayed in both hexadecimal and decimal form.

> b.With this PDU frame still selected in the top section, navigate to

>
> **The MAC addresses for all three locations are the same.**
>
> How does this information differ from the local ping information you

>
> **When pinging a computer on the same network, you get the MAC address
> of that computer\'s network card. When pinging a computer outside your
> local network, you get the MAC address of your router\'s LAN
> interface.**
>
> Reflection Question\
> **Why does Wireshark show the actual MAC address of the local hosts,
> but not the actual MAC address for the remote hosts?**
>
> **When communicating with a remote host beyond the local network, the
> precise MAC addresses for those hosts are unknown within the local
> network. Therefore, the MAC address of the default gateway, acting as
> a central hub for external communications, is utilized. Upon reaching
> the default gateway router, the packet undergoes a process where the
> existing Layer 2 (Data Link Layer) information is stripped from the
> packet. Subsequently, a new Layer 2 header is affixed to the packet,
> containing the destination MAC address of the next hop router. This
> ensures the packet is directed accurately to its intended destination
> beyond the local network.**

> **Conclusion**\
> In this project, we used Wireshark to capture and analyze ICMP data
> for both local and remote hosts. When pinging a local host, the MAC
> address of the PC\'s NIC was obtained, while for remote hosts, the MAC
> address of the default gateway LAN interface was retrieved. Notably,
> remote host MAC addresses were the same, representing the default
> gateway\'s LAN interface. This project illuminated the MAC address
> handling differences between local and remote ICMP communication,
> enhancing understanding of network protocols and data transportation.
